LeetLink - DSA Challenge Hub

Search-Engine - LeetLink
// Description The project presents a search engine for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions. It involves an scraping process, where 2905 problems were extracted from LeetCode using Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup in Python.

The core of the project revolves around the implementation of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, enabling efficient search functionality for the DSA problems. By utilizing TF-IDF, the search engine determines the relevance of a query to each document in the database.

I have integrated frontend and backend components using Node.js, Express, and EJS, and successfully deployed the application on Render to ensure accessibility for users. This project, available on my GitHub repository, demonstrates my skills in web scraping, text processing, algorithm implementation, and seamless frontend-backend integration. It serves as a showcase of my ability to create efficient and user-centric search engines, utilizing a variety of technologies and methodologies.
